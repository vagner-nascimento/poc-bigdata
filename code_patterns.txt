- * Use pure functions instead of objects with methods.

- Functions should specify types for both received and returned data.

- Log each step of the processing with necessary data to help in future errors debugging.

- Project strutcture:
    - README.md
    - docker-compose.yml
    - 1_first_script\
    - 2_second_script\
    - 3_third_script\
    - and so on...

- Script strutcture:
    - 1_first_script\
        - requirements.txt
        - main.py
        - src/
            - functions/ -> functions folder
                - data/ -> functions that interate with some data colletion/view
                    - transactions.py
                    - monthly_amount.py
                    - etc.py

    #### explanning ####
    - requirements.txt -> the requirements file, each project's function should have it own.
    - main.py -> the startup script which calls functions in order to acomplish its goals.
    - src/ -> source codes folder, where the script's core code should be.
    - src/functions/ -> functions folder.
    - src/functions/data -> where the functions that interate over data should be.
    - src/funtions/data/transactions.py -> contains functions that interate over a data domain, calls necessary infra/lib resources to interate over this data

* Pure functions means that only receives data, process and return another data without change original received data or any other context data.
